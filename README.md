‚úÖ**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing crime data to derive meaningful insights. The dataset includes information on drug-related crimes, different types of crimes, population data, and crime summaries for the years 2015-2016. The analysis is conducted using R programming and various data visualization techniques.

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**Questions Addressed**

-List the number of drug-related crimes per province in descending order.

-Count the number of different crimes that occur in the Western Cape.

-What is the effect of population based on different areas?

-The distribution of the density among provinces.

-Provide the summary of the crimes that occurred during 2015-2016.

ü™ô**Methodology**

-Question 1: SQL query to count drug-related crimes per province.

-Question 2: SQL query to count different crimes in the Western Cape.

-Question 3: Visualization using ggplot to show the effect of population based on different areas.

-Question 4: Visualization using ggplot to display the distribution of density among provinces.

-Question 5: R code to summarize crimes that occurred during 2015-2016.


‚úÖ**Conclusion**
